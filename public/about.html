<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a technology and software student, 24 years old and I currently live in Brazil. I started a journey creating
  small projects so I can learn through practice, so far it's been a fun ride, a lot of work but very helpful at the
  end of the day. </p>

<p>These small projects I build now will help me reach bigger goals in the future, like creating websites with complex
  lines of coding in them, I also hope that through this I can show my dedication and passion and make other people see
  potencial in me and in my work.</p>
